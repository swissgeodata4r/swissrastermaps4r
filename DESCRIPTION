Title: Helps Import, Extract and Plot Swissmapraster Data  
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nils Ratnaweera
Maintainer: Nils Ratnaweera <rata@zhaw.ch>
Description: This Package is meant as a Bridge between Swissmapraster
    Data (SMR) and R. It is the hope of the package developer(s) that this
    Package will prove to be necessary for a short time period, just so long
    till SwissMapRaster Data is freely and openly available to the public, 
    along with an appropriate R-interface. Unfortunately, since the SMR
    Data is still behind a paywall, this package does not provide access to 
    this data. It simply provides an interface for cases where the data is
    already available to the user.
