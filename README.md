# swissrastermaps4r
R-Package: An attempt to make Swiss Raster Maps (SMR, LK, PK, TA) easily available to R

Package Documentation: https://swissgeodata4r.github.io/swissrastermaps4r/


# Important notice

I'm currently the only one using this package. Things break freaquently and there is absolutly no backwards compatibility. Please tell me if you are planing to use this package so I will take greater care!

# ToDos / Plans

- Resolve the issue with naming the 1:1'000'000 files (also allow different representations of the same map)
- allow different patterns in a single folder (with multiple .pattern Files)
