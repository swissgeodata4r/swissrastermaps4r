# Important notice

I'm currently the only one using this package. Things break frequently and there is absolutly no backwards compatibility. Please tell me if you are planing to use this package so I will take greater care!

# ToDos / Plans

- update the docs
- make `factor =` in `guess_scale()` a global option and / or pass options to nested functions as named lists
