## What's the idea behind swissmapraster 4 R?

This Package is meant as a Bridge between Swissmapraster Data (SMR) and R. It is the hope of the package developer(s) that this Package will prove to be necessary for a short time period, just so long till SwissMapRaster Data is freely and openly available to the public,  along with an appropriate R-interface. Unfortunately, since the SMR Data is still behind a paywall, this package does not provide access to this data. It simply provides an interface for cases where the data is already available to the user.

## Does this package provide access to map data?

NO! This package does not give access to any raster maps, by swisstopo or otherwise. Access to this data has to be acquire elsewhere: Either through [swisstopo](https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch) directly or via third parties such as [geodata4edu](https://www.geodata4edu.ch). In fact, in the current version of the package the data has to be stored locally on your own hard drive (_urgh!_). Our hope is however, that this will change soon so that the data can be hosted on a network folder or on a GIS Server. 

## Who's in the team?

Currently, it's just [me](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/ueber-uns/person/rata/). But I'm hoping for some people to collaborate with and maybe we can level this up!
